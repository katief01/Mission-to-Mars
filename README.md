# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of this challenge was to adjust the web app created during this module to include the four Mars hemisphere images. To do this, we used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images.  We also stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
